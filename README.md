# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Project
We must complete additional analysis on data set including queries which are able to:
* Determine the number of retiring employees per title
* Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

### Purpose
To inspect how many employees are expected to retire en masse very soon at PH. 

## Results Summary

### How many employees are retiring?
Many senior level and lead positions are set to retire in quick succession.

At the moment, there are not enough people eligible for mentorship to cover these losses:

However, it is possible that there are some employees that are not eligible for the program yet, but will be soon. Suggest you look at:
* A table showing who may be eligible for promotions in the mid- or end- of year cycle, based on hire date and amount of time in current role
* A table showing how many junior employees will need to be hired in order to fill in gaps as seniors retire and others are promoted up
